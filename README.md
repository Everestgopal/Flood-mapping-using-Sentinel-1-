# Peace-Athabasca Delta Flood Assessment 2020

The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), located in northeastern Alberta, Canada, is one of the worldâ€™s most ecologically significant wetland ecosystems. It is recognized as both a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In May 2020, the PAD experienced severe flooding caused by snowmelt and heavy rainfall. This project investigates the flood extent using radar remote sensing techniques, specifically Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data processed through the SARscape module in ENVI.

## Data and Methods

- Three Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) images were used, representing pre-flood (April 23), during-flood (May 5), and post-flood (May 17) conditions.
- Processing steps included multilooking, coregistration, radiometric calibration, geocoding, flood classification, and refinement.
- These steps enabled accurate flood delineation despite atmospheric challenges such as cloud cover.

## Results

The study demonstrates the effectiveness of SAR-based approaches for rapid and reliable flood mapping in wetland ecosystems like the PAD.
